# Miro JSON Graph Diagram App

Miro JSON Graph Diagram App is a full diagramming toolbox for Miro. It began as
a simple JSON importer but now bundles extensive board utilities. Graphs and
cards can be loaded from JSON, arranged automatically via the **Eclipse Layout
Kernel**, and customised through reusable shape templates. Extra sidebar tabs
handle resizing, styling, grid layout, frames, exporting and even comment and
dataâ€‘binding workflows.

## Features

- Template-based shapes and connector styles
- Automatic ELK layout with nested container support
- Utility tabs for resizing, styling and exporting widgets
- Grid placement and frame management helpers

- Export to PNG, SVG, BPMN or Markdown
- Live data bindings and comment threads
